    <h1>Welcome to the 2019 CCDC event!</h1>
    <p>To get you started, here's some important information and references. <ul>
            <li>Your team name is "{display_name}"", and we have auto-generated a team ID for your team.</li>
            <li>Your team ID is {team_id}</li>
            <li>You'll need this team ID when submitting flags, <i>don't lose this</i>! To submit flags, you will need
                to use the <a href="https://ccdc.zone/scores/submit">flag submission page</a>. </li>
            <li>To see the scoreboard, go to the <a href="https://ccdc.zone/scores/dashboard">score dashboard</a></li>
            <li>This team ID is unique to your team, so don't share it with members of other teams.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Your team has been allocated an environment for today, complete with targets, as well as VMs for you to remote
        into that will contain all of the tools you will need today. You can find your team's starting package <a
            href="https://ccdc.zone/packages/{team_id}.zip">here</a>. <ul>
            <li>This package contains passwords, private keys, hostnames, and other information to get you and your
                teammates started.</li>
            <li>Inside of the zip package, you'll see a few files that start with the word `jumpbox`. These files
                contain the details for access your team's jumpboxes (<a target="_blank"
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_server">Ref</a>). There are 5 jumpboxes for your team, so
                you and your teammates can decide who gets which jumpbox (they are numbered for your convenience). </li>
            <li><b>THE JUMP BOXES ARE NOT IN SCOPE OF THE EVENT.</b> They are provided as ready-made environments,
                complete with all of the tools you will need during the event. If there are tools you want to use that
                are not installed in the jumpboxes, you are welcome to install them (you have full Administrator
                credentials to these jumpboxes), however <i>you do so at your own risk</i>. <b>IF YOU LOCK YOURSELF OUT
                    OF YOUR JUMPBOX, WE WILL NOT PROVISION A NEW ONE AND YOU WILL NEED TO DEPEND ON YOUR TEAMMATES</b>.
            </li>
            <li>To access your chosen jumpbox, you will need to RDP into it using the hostname and credentials in the
                corresponding file. Microsoft has documentation on how their applications (<a target="_blank"
                    href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-clients">Ref</a>),
                and for those on Linux we recommend using the <a target="_blank" href="https://remmina.org/">Remmina
                    remote desktop client</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p> This should be enough to get you started, but you will need to read the <a href="https://ccdc.zone/documentation">official
            complete documentation</a> for all of the information you will need to be successful today. </p>
